# TUM Thesis Template
Simple and up-to-date (2024) template for bachelor's / master's theses written at the previous Faculty for Informatics at the Technical University of Munich (now School of Computation, Information and Technology).
Please make sure to check the [current regulations](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/students/thesis-completing-your-studies/informatics/)!

Please note that this is my personal thesis template, there is a slightly more "official" template that can be found here: https://github.com/TUM-Dev/tum-thesis-latex
